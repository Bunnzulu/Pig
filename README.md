Players: 2+
How to Play:
Players take turns rolling a die as many times as they want, adding the number of points from each roll to their score.
However, if a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all points from that round.
Players can choose to "Bank" and end their turn to bank their points before rolling a 1.
First player to reach 100 points wins.
